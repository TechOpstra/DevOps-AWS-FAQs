Helm:
* A package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and updating applications and services on Kubernetes and maintains the consistency.
* Helm uses charts to define, install, and manage Kubernetes applications.

Chart:
* A  Helm chart is a collection of files that describe a set of Kubernetes resources (such as deployments, services, config maps, etc.) 
*  and the configuration values required to deploy and manage an application. A chart can be thought of as a "blueprint" for deploying a particular application or service.

Helm chart components:

chart.yaml -- it contains the metadata of the chart like name of the chart, app version, chart version and apiversion of the chart, a brief description of the chart's purpose etc
values.yaml -- the values.yaml contains the default values for the chart like replica count,port services,types,image etc, we can override these values --set flags or manually or we can upgrade through helm
templates -- the template direcotry contains the kubernetes resource manifest files

helm charts will be available in a remote public repos, a helm repo is a collection of packaged charts
we can add the repos in and we can install the charts through this repos 

ex: helm stable and prometheus-community are the public repos

we can install charts with command like 

helm install release-name reponame/chart-name

helm upgrade myrelease-name reponame/chart-name --- we can upgrade by modifying the values.yaml in the chart or we can pass values.yaml in the cli as -f values.yaml

Imp cmds:

helm create chart-name  -- to create a chart
helm install release-name chart-name -n namespace
helm list -- it wil list all releases
helm upgrade release-name chartname
helm rollback release-name revision-number
helm uninstall release-name  -- it will remove rlease and its associated k8s resources 
helm history release-name -- to ge the revision numbersl list

through a remote repo:

helm repo add repo-name url
helm repo update
helm install release-name repo-name/chart-name
helm upgrade release-name repo-name/chart-name
